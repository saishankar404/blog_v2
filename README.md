## What is it
A  personal site + blog built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It features a clean design system, dark mode support, and a responsive layout <br> (still working to support all devices tho).

## Why I built it
I built this to have a personal corner on the internet to share my projects, design experiments, and thoughts on computer science, design and web development
