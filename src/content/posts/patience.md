# a note on patience

people (including me) have forgotten a very basic fact that

***everything takes time.***

not in a motivational way. just literally. things don’t happen instantly, and they never have.

we live in a hyper-connected, digitally oversaturated world where we’re always in a hurry. every day, every task, every goal. speed is expected. results are expected. excellence is expected… and expected quickly.

that’s scary.

## the rush

because what usually happens is this: you reach a level that feels good to you, decide it’s “pretty solid,” and then plateau there. not because you’ve mastered anything, but because you’re tired of waiting. and often, that level is actually very low compared to what you could’ve reached if you stayed longer.

rushing the process of excellence doesn’t create great work.  
it creates widespread mediocrity.

## ego vs patience

when you don’t give yourself enough time to become genuinely good at something… whatever it is… you eventually start telling yourself:

*“i’ve put in enough effort. i should be good at this by now.”*

but that’s not an honest evaluation. it’s just ego filling the gap where patience should be. it’s self-validation without proof.  
a quiet way of inflating your sense of progress so you don’t have to sit with how early you still are.

## the illusion of fast paths

online, we only ever see outcomes. milestones. achievements. announcements. our brains slowly start believing that the path itself has been shortened, that everyone else figured out a faster way.

but those twitter posts and linkedin wins are just the visible end of something that took months or years of waiting, whether the person realized it or not.

## patience, reframed

patience has always been foundational to human growth. across history, it’s been treated as a form of strength, not passivity. discipline, not weakness.

the digital world does the opposite. it weakens our patience muscle.

small delays start to feel unbearable. a late reply. a slow response. a goal that doesn’t show up on time. these things frustrate us more than they should because we’ve been conditioned to expect everything instantly.

ironically, those moments are where patience is actually built.

---

## productivity culture

then there’s unrealistic productivity culture.

we’re constantly told to do more, be more, move faster. in that mindset, waiting feels like falling behind. patience feels like a flaw. rest feels unproductive.

but real progress isn’t always visible. not every season is meant for speed. sometimes nothing looks like it’s happening, even though something important is forming underneath.

---

# conclusion

sometimes patience is the most productive choice you can make — not because it feels good, but because it values timing over urgency, and depth over speed.

and it keeps you honest about where and who you actually are.
